    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p class="muc1">
      Cascading Style Sheeets(CSS) is used to format the layout a webpage
    </p>
    <p class="muc2">
      With CSS, you can control the color, the size of the text, the spacing
      between elemnts, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background
      images or background colors are to be used, different displays for
      different devices and screen size, and much more!
    </p>
    <p class="muc3">
      <span>Tip:</span> The word <span>cascading</span> means that a style
      appiled to a parent element will aslo apply to all children elements
      within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to"blue", all
      headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will aslo
      get the same color(unless you specify something else)!
